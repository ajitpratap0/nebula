Nebula Performance Bottleneck Analysis
=====================================

Timestamp: 2025-11-19T11:02:55+05:30
Summary: Found 3 bottlenecks: 2 critical, 
Primary bottleneck: Memory growing at 433271725868166.56 MB/s - potential memory leak (memory)

Bottlenecks:
-----------

1. [CRITICAL] Memory growing at 433271725868166.56 MB/s - potential memory leak
   Type: memory
   Component: memory_allocator
   Impact: 4332717258681665.5%
   Suggestions:
   - Profile heap allocations to identify leak source
   - Check for unbounded data structures
   - Ensure proper cleanup of resources
   - Use object pools for frequently allocated objects
   Details:
   - growth_rate_mb_per_s: 4.3327172586816656e+14
   - total_growth_mb: 1.7592186044390898e+13
   - duration: 40.603125ms

2. [CRITICAL] GC overhead 24.5% - excessive garbage collection
   Type: gc
   Component: garbage_collector
   Impact: 24.5%
   Suggestions:
   - Reduce allocation rate
   - Use object pools
   - Pre-allocate slices with appropriate capacity
   - Consider using value types instead of pointers where appropriate
   - Profile allocations to identify high-frequency allocators
   Details:
   - gc_pause_last_ms: 0
   - gc_overhead_percent: 24.5327964288463
   - num_gc: 42
   - gc_pause_total_ms: 9

3. [LOW] CPU underutilization: 10 goroutines on 14 CPUs
   Type: concurrency
   Component: parallelism
   Impact: 28.6%
   Suggestions:
   - Increase parallelism for CPU-bound operations
   - Use worker pools sized to CPU count
   - Consider data partitioning for parallel processing
   Details:
   - gomaxprocs: 14
   - num_cpu: 14
   - num_goroutines: 10

Prioritized Recommendations:
