Nebula Performance Bottleneck Analysis
=====================================

Timestamp: 2025-11-19T11:02:55+05:30
Summary: Found 2 bottlenecks: 1 critical, 1 high severity, 
Primary bottleneck: Memory growing at 392.17 MB/s - potential memory leak (memory)

Bottlenecks:
-----------

1. [CRITICAL] Memory growing at 392.17 MB/s - potential memory leak
   Type: memory
   Component: memory_allocator
   Impact: 3921.7%
   Suggestions:
   - Profile heap allocations to identify leak source
   - Check for unbounded data structures
   - Ensure proper cleanup of resources
   - Use object pools for frequently allocated objects
   Details:
   - growth_rate_mb_per_s: 392.17266075854747
   - total_growth_mb: 19.461029052734375
   - duration: 49.623625ms

2. [HIGH] GC overhead 16.7% - excessive garbage collection
   Type: gc
   Component: garbage_collector
   Impact: 16.7%
   Suggestions:
   - Reduce allocation rate
   - Use object pools
   - Pre-allocate slices with appropriate capacity
   - Consider using value types instead of pointers where appropriate
   - Profile allocations to identify high-frequency allocators
   Details:
   - gc_overhead_percent: 16.716831952522615
   - num_gc: 35
   - gc_pause_total_ms: 8
   - gc_pause_last_ms: 0

Prioritized Recommendations:
---------------------------
1. Profile heap allocations to identify leak source
