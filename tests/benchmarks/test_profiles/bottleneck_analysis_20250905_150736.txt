Summary: Found 1 bottlenecks: 1 critical, 
Primary bottleneck: Memory growing at 40.20 MB/s - potential memory leak (memory)

Bottlenecks:
-----------

1. [CRITICAL] Memory growing at 40.20 MB/s - potential memory leak
   Type: memory
   Component: memory_allocator
   Impact: 402.0%
   Suggestions:
   - Profile heap allocations to identify leak source
   - Check for unbounded data structures
   - Ensure proper cleanup of resources
   - Use object pools for frequently allocated objects
