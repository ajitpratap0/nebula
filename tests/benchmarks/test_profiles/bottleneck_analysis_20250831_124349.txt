Nebula Performance Bottleneck Analysis
=====================================

Timestamp: 2025-08-31T12:43:49+05:30
Summary: Found 2 bottlenecks: 2 critical, 
Primary bottleneck: Memory growing at 352634793573144.88 MB/s - potential memory leak (memory)

Bottlenecks:
-----------

1. [CRITICAL] Memory growing at 352634793573144.88 MB/s - potential memory leak
   Type: memory
   Component: memory_allocator
   Impact: 3526347935731449.0%
   Suggestions:
   - Profile heap allocations to identify leak source
   - Check for unbounded data structures
   - Ensure proper cleanup of resources
   - Use object pools for frequently allocated objects
   Details:
   - total_growth_mb: 1.7592186044401318e+13
   - duration: 49.887834ms
   - growth_rate_mb_per_s: 3.526347935731449e+14

2. [CRITICAL] GC overhead 23.6% - excessive garbage collection
   Type: gc
   Component: garbage_collector
   Impact: 23.6%
   Suggestions:
   - Reduce allocation rate
   - Use object pools
   - Pre-allocate slices with appropriate capacity
   - Consider using value types instead of pointers where appropriate
   - Profile allocations to identify high-frequency allocators
   Details:
   - gc_overhead_percent: 23.610219277108722
   - num_gc: 68
   - gc_pause_total_ms: 11
   - gc_pause_last_ms: 0
