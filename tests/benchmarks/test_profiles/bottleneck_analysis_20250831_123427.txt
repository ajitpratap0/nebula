Nebula Performance Bottleneck Analysis
=====================================

Timestamp: 2025-08-31T12:34:27+05:30
Summary: Found 2 bottlenecks: 1 critical, 1 high severity, 
Primary bottleneck: Memory growing at 629.96 MB/s - potential memory leak (memory)

Bottlenecks:
-----------

1. [CRITICAL] Memory growing at 629.96 MB/s - potential memory leak
   Type: memory
   Component: memory_allocator
   Impact: 6299.6%
   Suggestions:
   - Profile heap allocations to identify leak source
   - Check for unbounded data structures
   - Ensure proper cleanup of resources
   - Use object pools for frequently allocated objects
   Details:
   - total_growth_mb: 30.61345672607422
   - duration: 48.596166ms
   - growth_rate_mb_per_s: 629.956213543147

2. [HIGH] GC overhead 14.2% - excessive garbage collection
   Type: gc
   Component: garbage_collector
   Impact: 14.2%
   Suggestions:
   - Reduce allocation rate
   - Use object pools
   - Pre-allocate slices with appropriate capacity
   - Consider using value types instead of pointers where appropriate
   - Profile allocations to identify high-frequency allocators
   Details:
   - gc_overhead_percent: 14.242047407608247
   - num_gc: 50
   - gc_pause_total_ms: 6
   - gc_pause_last_ms: 0

Prioritized Recommendations:
---------------------------
1. Profile heap allocations to identify leak source

4. Use object pools for frequently allocated objects
5. Reduce allocation rate
6. Use object pools
7. Pre-allocate slices with appropriate capacity
8. Consider using value types instead of pointers where appropriate
9. Profile allocations to identify high-frequency allocators
