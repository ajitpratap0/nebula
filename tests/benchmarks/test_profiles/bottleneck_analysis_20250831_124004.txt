Nebula Performance Bottleneck Analysis
=====================================

Timestamp: 2025-08-31T12:40:04+05:30
Summary: Found 1 bottlenecks: 
Primary bottleneck: CPU underutilization: 0 goroutines on 16 CPUs (concurrency)

Bottlenecks:
-----------

1. [LOW] CPU underutilization: 0 goroutines on 16 CPUs
   Type: concurrency
   Component: parallelism
   Impact: 100.0%
   Suggestions:
   - Increase parallelism for CPU-bound operations
   - Use worker pools sized to CPU count
   - Consider data partitioning for parallel processing
   Details:
   - num_goroutines: 0
   - gomaxprocs: 16
   - num_cpu: 16

Prioritized Recommendations:
---------------------------
1. Continue monitoring performance metrics
2. Establish performance baselines
3. Set up continuous profiling
