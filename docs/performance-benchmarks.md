## Notes

- Benchmarks use synthetic data for consistency across storage modes
- Real-world performance may vary based on data characteristics and access patterns
- Hybrid storage mode selection is validated against realistic workload patterns
- Network and external API performance not included in local benchmarks
- Storage mode overhead is measured separately from core processing performance
- Focus on relative performance improvements and storage mode efficiency
- Phase 5 achievements (84 bytes/record) represent a breakthrough in Go-based memory efficiency
